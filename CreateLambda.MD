# AWS Lambda
AWS Lambda is a compute service which allows you to run the code without creating or managing any server. Code is only executed when needed and costing is based on the usage. AWS Lambda can be used to run the codes on the basis of triggered events such as - Kinesis Event, S3 Event, SNS Event, SQS Event etc.

AWS Lambda can be used to expose Rest APIs with the help of AWS API Gateway. There is no need to provision any servers to run your code. You can write your code in multiple languages supported by AWS - Java, NodeJs, Python, Go etc.
